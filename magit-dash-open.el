;;; magit-dash-open.el --- Interactive git repository picker for magit-dash -*- lexical-binding: t; -*-

;;; Commentary:
;; Provides `magit-dash-open-repo', a context-aware repository picker using
;; `annotated-completing-read'.  Behaviour adapts to the calling context:
;;
;;   - Current directory is a git repo (non-magit buffer):
;;       Only the repo's worktrees and submodules are offered.
;;   - Current buffer is a magit-status buffer:
;;       Scans from the parent of the current repo; also merges `~/' at
;;       depth 1 so sibling repos and home-level repos appear together.
;;   - Otherwise:
;;       Scans subdirectories of `default-directory'.
;;
;; In all cases live magit-status buffers are included in the candidate list
;; and marked "[open]"; selecting one switches to it directly.

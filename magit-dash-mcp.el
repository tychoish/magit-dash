;; Provides `mcpkit' tools for higher-level `magit-dash' PR, worktree,
;; and branch pruning operations:
;;   - `manage_worktrees'
;;   - `create_worktree_for_pr'
;;   - `clean_merged_worktrees'
;;   - `prune_branches'
;;   - `magit_dash_pr_status'
;;   - `chain_plan' and `chain_resume' (PR chain merge plans, see `magit-dash-chain')
;;   - `stack_show' and `stack_sync' (local branch stacks, see `magit-dash-stack')

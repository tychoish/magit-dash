;;; Commentary:

;; Discover a chain (or tree) of dependent pull requests -- a PR whose
;; base branch is another PR's head branch -- validate it, render it, and
;; propose a sequence of merges as a `hitl-plan' in the `magit-dash-chain'
;; domain.
;;
;; Each node, in topological order, gets an `update' step: the parent
;; branch (or the base branch for the root) is merged INTO the node's
;; branch in the node's worktree with `git merge --no-ff'.  History is
;; never rewritten: this module never invokes rebase, pull or a forced
;; push (`magit-dash-chain--git' refuses those arguments outright).
;;
;; Nothing is pushed by default.  With the `land' option the plan also
;; contains separate `land' steps (push the branch, merge the PR with
;; `gh', fetch the base).  They are ordinary plan steps, so hitl-plan's
;; approval gating covers them, and they additionally refuse to run for
;; an unapproved MCP-origin plan.
;;
;; A conflicting merge halts the plan with the worktree left in its
;; merge state and the conflicted files recorded in the plan.  The plan
;; is resumed with `magit-dash-chain-resume': a step interrupted by a
;; conflict is retried, notices the in-progress merge, and -- once the
;; conflicts are resolved -- finishes the merge commit and continues.
;; `magit-dash-chain-conflict-strategy' can instead hand the conflict to
;; an agent (agent-shell or gptel); the agent paths are soft
;; dependencies and fall back to halting.
;;
;; The plan's `.eld' file (and a sibling `.org' record) is rewritten as
;; each step runs, so it is a live record that survives an Emacs
;; restart: load the plan and call `magit-dash-chain-resume'.

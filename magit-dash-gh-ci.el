;;; magit-dash-gh-ci.el --- Lightweight GitHub Actions CI status for magit-dash -*- lexical-binding: t -*-

;; Author: tycho garen
;; Maintainer: tychoish
;; Version: 0.1.0
;; Package-Requires: ((emacs "29.1") (magit "4.0"))
;; Keywords: vc, tools, magit, github, ci
;; URL: https://github.com/tychoish/dot-emacs

;; This file is not part of GNU Emacs

;;; Commentary:

;; Provides lightweight CI status fetch for the magit-dash main repository
;; dashboard.  Fetches the most recent gh run list for the current branch,
;; caches the result as :ci-status in the shared magit-dash-gh cache, and
;; provides formatting, browser-open, and (stubbed) fix-CI dispatch.
;;
;; This is intentionally separate from magit-dash-gh-actions.el, which
;; downloads full CI logs interactively.  This module only fetches summary
;; data for dashboard rendering.
